# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
For this project, we analyzed a large data set of Amazon reviews to measure the success of the Amazon Vine program, which is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. We worked with a large data set of reviews for products from Amazon and tested to see if there was a higher percentage of five-star reviews for products that used the Amazon Vine program.

## Results

* How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?

There were 585 Vine reviews and 61,139 non-Vine reviews.

* How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

The total number of five-star Vine reviews was 213. The total number of five-star non-Vine reviews was 28,839

* What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

The percentage of five star reviews for Vine reviews was approximately 36.4%, while percentage of five star reviews for non-Vine reviews was approximately 47.2%.

## Summary

Based on the analysis we conducted, we did not find any positive bias toward Amazon Vine reviews when compared to non-Vine reviews. We can conclude this for the dataset we were given because the percentage of 5-star reviews from Amazon's Vine program was not higher than the percentage for non-Vine reviews, so there is no evidence from our analysis to support the notion of positive bias. However, we would recommend that further analysis be conducted into not just the percentage of five-star reviews, but on the average star-rating of Vine and non-Vine reviews as well. Hypothetically, we could be missing a positive bias by focusing only on 5-star ratings because the average score of Vine reviews could still be higher than the average rating of non-Vine reviews. We would certainly recommend further analysis be done on this before solidly concluding that there is no positive bias for Amazon Vine reviews.
